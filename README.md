**Installation guide:**

After installation of [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-391/), you need to install Pygame and Pillow (Python Libraries).


Installation procedure of required Python libraries is as follows:

1. Open 'Command Prompt' (cmd) by typing cmd in Start menu or press Win + R and typing cmd.

2. To install a python library type in: 


```bash
pip install *library_name*
```


3. For installing Pygame, type in:

 ```bash
 pip install pygame
 ```

Similarly, for pillow:

```bash
pip install pillow
```


**Running the game:**

Within the root directory, launch the game from 'main.py'.

1. A menu will launch in which you will be prompted to enter in your login credentials to play the game.
